# Nightsparrow

Create and manage websites without losing your mind.

Nightsparrow makes building and managing websites easy.

## The state of this project

Nightsparrow was built for Infokup 2016. and it's still in development. Although this version was demonstrated on Infokup, we still need to polish some things before the first stable public release. We'll publish a timeline soon*ish*, but feel free to contribute anything you want to the project.

### So how did Infokup go?

Nightsparrow came in fourth, but hey, One Direction didn't win on The X Factor either.

### Documentation
There's now a wiki we're working on: https://phabulous.pulsir.eu/w/nightsparrow/

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to send me an email and I'll point you in the right way.
